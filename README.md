# viewdb

A database query tool that supports sqlite and mysql.

It uses gtk v2.24 as the UI library which is very old and will need to be updated (see https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/porting.html).

Should also be updated to python 3 at the same time.

2009 was the last time I did any work on this.
